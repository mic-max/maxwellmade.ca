## Overview

This Shaker peg rail is built using traditional proportions and solid hardwood.

You can order any specific length of peg rail or peg spacing. Standard is 6" on centers. and I like to keep them 3" from the ends of the rail since that is the same amount of space that the internal pegs have.

I currently buy the pegs from Lee valley but I want to turn my own once I buy a lathe to make more unique profiles, sizes, and use different species of woods.
